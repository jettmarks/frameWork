  Provides framework for common app functionality: version reporting and 
  argument parsing.
  
  The Versioning is dependent on placement of properties within the .jar file.
  These properties are intended to be maintained by Maven, but can be placed
  either manually, using Ant, or other methods.  
  
  The Argument Parsing is built upon the commons-cli API.  The framework 
  includes a main(String args[]) method which calls the application's entry 
  point.  This entry point is defined by the application by extending
  the class ArgParsingEntryPoint and implementing the methods for parsing and
  then executing.
